#1. Give the count of the minimum number of days for the time when temperature reduced
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT date, Minimum_temperature____F_,
         LAG(Minimum_temperature____F_) OVER (ORDER BY date) AS prev_temp
  FROM `analog-figure-377104`.weather.weather
)
SELECT COUNT(date) as Count_of_days_when_Temperature_reduced
FROM cte
WHERE Minimum_temperature____F_ < prev_temp

#2. Find the temperature as Cold / hot by using the case and avg of values of the given data set
WITH cte AS (
   SELECT AVG(Average_temperature____F_) AS avg_temp
   FROM analog-figure-377104.weather.weather

else "Hot"
end as Temp_class

#4. Can you find the maximum number of days for which temperature dropped
with cte as (select date,Average_temperature____F_,
                    lag(Average_temperature____F_)OVER (order by date) as prev_temp

#6. Use the GROUP BY clause on the Date column and make a query to fetch details for average windspeed ( which is now windspeed done in task 3 )
select count(date) as count, Average_windspeed__mph_ from `analog-figure-377104`.weather.weather
group by Average_windspeed__mph_

#9. Find the number of days when the temperature went below 0 degrees Celsius
select count(date) as Number_of_days_below_0_Celsius from `analog-figure-377104`.weather.weather
where Minimum_temperature____F_ < 32;
